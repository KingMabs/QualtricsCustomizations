# Qualtrics Customizations
Simple CSS overrides (adapted from Qualtrics's own CSS) for customizing existing Qualtrics templates. These will be geared towards the Kent State color palette, but can be used as a starting point for users outside of Kent State.

3. Click the **Advanced** tab, then click **Add Custom CSS**.

4. Copy and paste the [customization CSS code](https://github.com/kyeager4/QualtricsCustomizations/blob/master/item%20color%20customizations%20-%20boxed%20questions%20template.css) into this window. Then click **Save**.

5. When finished, click the **Save** button in the Look & Feel window to finish.

6. Be sure to preview your survey to make sure that the colors are applied as you expect them to be.
